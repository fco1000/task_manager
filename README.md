# Task Manager

A small Django web application (project `task_manager`) with one app `manager` that provides simple task and worker management.

This README describes the current repository state and how to run the project locally. It reflects files present in the repository (no assumptions about Docker/CI unless they exist).

## What's in this repo

- `manage.py` — Django management script.
- `task_manager/` — Django project package (`settings.py`, `urls.py`, `wsgi.py`, `asgi.py`).
- `manager/` — Django app with `models.py`, `views.py`, `forms.py`, `templates/`, and `migrations/`.
- `manager/templates/` — HTML templates included: `base.html`, `home.html`, `tasks.html`, `form.html`, `workers.html`.
- `manager/migrations/` — migration history for the app is included.
- `db.sqlite3` — SQLite database file (development convenience).
- `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml` — dependency metadata (project currently depends on Django and a couple of helper packages).

## Key implementation notes (current)

- Models: `Task` and `Worker` are defined in `manager/models.py`. `Task` includes fields like `task_id`, `title`, `description`, `assigned_worker`, `due_date`, `priority_level`, and `completed`. `Worker` has `name`, `email` and a ManyToMany to tasks.
- Views: standard function and class-based views live in `manager/views.py` and use `manager/forms.py`'s `TaskForm` and `WorkerForm`.
- Templates: the app renders pages for home, task list, worker list and a generic `form.html` used for creates/updates.
- Settings: `task_manager/settings.py` configures SQLite as the default DB, `DEBUG = True`, and includes `manager`, `django_bootstrap5`, and `django_browser_reload` in `INSTALLED_APPS`.

## Requirements / dependencies

- The repository contains `requirements.txt` (autogenerated) and `pyproject.toml` listing these direct dependencies:
	- `django>=6.0`
	- `django-bootstrap5`
	- `django-browser-reload`

Install dependencies with pip using the provided `requirements.txt`.

## Quick start (local, Windows PowerShell)

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```


2. Install dependencies (using `uv`):

If you use `uv` to manage the environment and dependencies (this repo's `requirements.txt` was generated by `uv export`), run:

```powershell
uv install
```

3. Apply migrations and create a superuser (using `uv`):

```powershell
uv run python manage.py migrate
uv run python manage.py createsuperuser
```

4. Run the development server (using `uv`):

```powershell
uv run manage.py runserver
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to view the site and `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` for the admin.

## Running tests

Run Django tests with:

```powershell
python manage.py test
```

## Configuration notes

- Current settings include a hard-coded `SECRET_KEY` and `DEBUG = True` in `task_manager/settings.py`. These are fine for local development but must be changed before any production deployment.
- Database: default is SQLite (`db.sqlite3`) as configured in `task_manager/settings.py`.

## Static files

For development Django serves static files automatically. If you prepare this app for production you will need to configure static file collection and serving (not present in this repo).

## What is intentionally not included

- There is no `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, or CI workflow in the repository. I will not add or mention deployment scaffolding unless you ask for it.

## Where to look in the code

- `manager/models.py` — model definitions for `Task` and `Worker`.
- `manager/forms.py` — `TaskForm` and `WorkerForm`.
- `manager/views.py` — view functions and classes (task listing, create/update, worker views).
- `manager/templates/` — presentation templates used by the views.
- `manager/migrations/` — migration history.

---

If you'd like, I can next:
- generate a minimal `requirements.txt` (done already) or a `pyproject.lock`/constraints from your environment,
- add a simple GitHub Actions workflow to run tests,
- or create a short CONTRIBUTING.md describing local workflow.

Tell me which (if any) of those you'd like me to add.
